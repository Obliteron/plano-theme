# plano-theme
A flat theme for Gnome 3.18

Currently in alpha state. Todo list:
- Fix a proper gtk2 style.
- Adjust some assets.
- Change some gtk3 styles from the adwaita defaults to have no gradients and less rounded borders.
- Several tweaks needed for the gnome-shell theme.
- Unity support.
- Whatever else I've forgotten.
